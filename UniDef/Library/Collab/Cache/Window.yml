  RevisionSummary: '- Added 2,3,4,5 drone setups to spawn more enemies at once

    -
    Worked on the spawning system, based on levels, it''s endless and dynamic (needs
    adjustments)

    - Level is added to the savefile (savefiles are not compatible
    with each other, need to delete the last save in order for to work)

    - New
    script: ContainerScript

    - Enemies are counted by their tag

    - After
    an enemy dies, it''s checked if we have any enemy on the map and evaluate if
    it''s the end of the round or not'
